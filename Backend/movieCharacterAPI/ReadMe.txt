This is a API project for creating and maintaining movies/charachters/franchises in a database. The database
is created using entity framework "code first" approach. The project is testable using Swagger.
In order to test the API yourself, add your connectionstring to the appsettings.json file.
You can add data using seeding by calling the function seedData() or use http requests.
